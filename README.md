# RetroGames
Old school video games, like Whack-A-Mole, Pong, and many others!
# Whack-A-Mole
## What I Learned 
* Object-Oriented Programming
  * Classes, objects, instance variables, etc.
  * Constructors, setters, getters
* 2D arrays
* Nested loops, do-while loops
* Regular Expressions, regex

# Pong (Glitches on the edge of paddle, need of more creativity)
## What I Learned 
* Object-Oriented Programming
  * Classes, objects, instance variables, etc.
  * Constructors, setters, getters
* Strings and Drawing Text
* stroke(), fill(),  ellipse(), rect(), etc..
* Built-in variables and methods
  * mouseX, mouseY, keyPressed, etc.
  
## Revise-Version (two-player, includes angle reflection, score board)
** Still under construction
* PVectors
* Angles, trigonmetric functions


# Snake
## What I Learned
* Object-Oriented Programming
  * Classes, objects, instance variables, etc.
  * Constructors
* PVector, PImage, PFont classes
* Frame rates
* Keyboard and mouse functionality
  * mouseX, mouseY, keyPressed, etc.
* Strings and Drawing Text
* stroke(), fill(),  ellipse(), rect(), etc..
* List, ArrayList
* Hexadecimal color codes
