# Pong (Glitches on the edge of paddle, need of more creativity)
## What I Learned 
* Object-Oriented Programming
  * Classes, objects, instance variables, etc.
  * Constructors, setters, getters
* Strings and Drawing Text
* stroke(), fill(),  ellipse(), rect(), etc..
* Built-in variables and methods
  * mouseX, mouseY, keyPressed, etc.
  
## Revise-Version (two-player, includes angle reflection, score board)
** Still under construction (glitching, more eloquent algoritms)
* PVectors, PFont
* Angles, trigonmetric functions

* Diagram for ball deflection, cutting the paddle into 8 sections and assigning them to certain angle deflections:
